I am a fourth year graduate student in Ecology and Evolution at the
University of Chicago, working with Stefano Allesina and Tim
Wootton. I am interested in studying and understanding complex
ecological networks using simulation, machine learning, and other
computational approaches. Outside of the lab, I like to play with
data, contribute to open source, and can sometimes be found
upside-down on a trapeze bar.

I spent this past summer honing my coding and machine learning skills
at a programming retreat called the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). It was pretty great! Take
a look!
