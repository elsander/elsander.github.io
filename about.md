I'm a data scientist doing research and development work at Civis
Analytics in Chicago. I like bringing a software design mentality to
data science problems, and turning one-time analyses into automated
workflows. I finished my doctorate in Ecology and Evolution at the
University of Chicago in 2017, where I studied complex ecological
network structure.

Outside of the office, I play board games, study Japanese, read
obsessively, and can sometimes be found upside-down on a trapeze bar.

When I was in grad school, I spent a summer at a programming retreat
called the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). It's where I
really learned to love thinking like a programmer, and it's an amazing
community of folks. Take a look!
