Last weekend I gave a talk at PyData Chicago! It was called
"Evolutionary Algorithms: Perfecting the Art of 'Good Enough'" (props
to my thesis advisor, Stefano Allesina, for the catchy title). It was
heavily based on my [blog post](http://www.lizsander.com/programming/2015/08/04/Heuristic-Search-Algorithms.html) and workshops I've given. Heuristic
optimizers are a fun topic for me because they are so general and
useful, but they're not really a hot topic, and I think a lot of
people have just never encountered them. They're a great
addition to a data scientist's toolkit.

It was my first tech talk, and a lot of fun. It was very different
from giving an academic talk. It was nice to give a talk that was
about getting people excited about a technique, rather than to present
results of a specific study. I'm very proud of the fact that I got to
talk about  managing Skyrim loot as an example of an optimization problem
(it's quite literally a knapsack problem!).
