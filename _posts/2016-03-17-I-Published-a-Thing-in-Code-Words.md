title: I Published a Thing in Code Words!

---

The [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) puts out a quarterly
publication called Code Words, which publishes articles that try to
capture the fun of digging into
a problem and learning about programming. I wrote a piece on the
grammar of graphics, and how it can provide a language for exploring
and talking about data visualization. It uses examples from R's
`ggplot` package, but the ideas are more general. Check out my
article, and other great articles from RC alums, in the 
[sixth issue of Code Words](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/six)!
